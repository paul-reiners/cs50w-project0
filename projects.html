      <h1>My Projects</h1>
      <p>
        These are personal programming projects I've done.  The projects listed
        here were done mainly to learn a particular programming technique or
        technology.  In that sense, none of them are meant to be particularly
        groundbreaking, but they should all be well-written and error-free.
