# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This website displays my project portfolio.  It also has a few other pages
describing my career.  It's basically an extended résumé.

## Files

* img
    - haskell.jpg: An image that is referred to from the home page.
* employers.html: Page with information about some of my former employees.  Illustrates the use of an HTML `table`.
* history.html: A narrative of my career.
* index.html: The home page.  Lists some of my favorite programming projects.  Demonstrates use of Bootstrap.
* requirements.md: Checklist to make sure I covered all the assignment requirements.
* styles.scss: Sassy CSS to generate styles.css.
* technology.html: Page describing computer languages (and 'technologies') I know.

## Notes

TODO My GitHub repository project also contains the files `styles.css` and `styles.css.map`.
Strictly speaking, these should not be contained in the source code repository since
they are generated by `styles.scss`.  However, GitHub Pages was not doing the SASS generation for me.
I did not want to take forever and possibly screw up my site by working on this
right now.  I plan on fixing this later.
