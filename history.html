      <h1>Career History</h1>
    	<p>
I was a math major as an undergraduate in college.  While in graduate school, I did a lot of computer programming as a hobby.  Hence I decided to get an M.S. in computer science and become a professional software developer.  I moved to the Bay Area and quickly found a job as a programmer with Siebel Systems.  I did C++, Java, and some Perl programming at Siebel.  After working at Siebel for six years, I got a job at IBM in Burlingame, California.  I worked in Burlingame for several years and then transferred to the IBM site in Rochester, Minnesota, where I also worked for several years.  At IBM, I primarily programmed in Java and J2EE.  I worked at IBM for seven years.  I wanted to live in the Twin Cities and found my next job at Pearson VUE in Bloomington, Minnesota.  Here I did Java programming, both on a desktop application and a web application.  I worked at Pearson for eight years.

During my last year or two at Pearson, I became interested in data science.  Data science involves both computer programming, which I love and am good at, with solving interesting analytical questions.  I spent over a year of evenings and weekends teaching myself data science.  I already knew the fundamentals of statistics from college, so that helped.  I mainly took online courses in data science from Johns Hopkins University through Coursera.  I found a job as a data scientist at TransVoyant and worked there for two years.

My main interest is still in solving challenging problems.  Whether this is in data science or other areas of software development is somewhat immaterial.  Whatever particular area I work in, I spend a lot of my own time in increasing my domain knowledge and increasing my understanding of the tools and techniques needed for that particular sub-field.
